## About me: Spontaneous, energetic and enthusiastic. Let me explain.

In Machine Learning Space-
If i hear linear regression, immediately i picturize two axes with a straight line in my mind.
If i come across Logistic regression, I immediately imagine a linear regression model fed to a sigmoid function to get class probabilities.
Branches of Decision tree is built based on Gini index and if multiple such trees with different configurations are considered in an ensemble, it is random forest.
Hypothesis is directly related to confidence intervals and critical values. 
Class predictions will lead to metrics from confusion matrices, numerical predictions will lead to MSE/RMSE metrics.

It is easy to say "In Machine learning, garbage in to garbage out". But it takes clear understanding of steps involved at different stages of analysis to realize the answer to 'why'.
I ability to quickly imagine and visualize the working of various models has helped me draw down a use case out of the data or understand what data we need for a particular use case.

In Personal life-
Very resetless guy who has his friends overwhelmed by random plans out of nowhere. Always try to bring everyone together, keep the harmony and bring the feel of a family in the group.

It is this personality which gives me confidence and motivation to learn and excel any skill, adapt anywhere and be a team player to achieve a common goal.
